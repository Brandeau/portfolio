    "whoQ" : "Who are you?",

    "whoA": "My name is Diego Andrade. I'm a professional translator who one day decided to learn coding. I've worked as a freelancer for the past 12 years translating text from English, Portuguese and Japanese. As a beginner programmer I've dabbled in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I particularly like JS's quirkiness, its unique type of inheritance and its flexibility. I have basic notions of React and MongoDB, as well as a bit of JQuery. I document my code with JSDOC and run tests with Jest. I'm familiarized with git/github, the command line and have a bit of knowledge of agile development.",
